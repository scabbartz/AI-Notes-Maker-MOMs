## Overview

Joules V2 (Free Edition) is an open-source, web-based tool designed to help you capture, understand, and extract value from your meetings. It allows you to:

*   **Record Audio:** Securely capture meeting audio directly in your browser.
*   **Transcribe Audio:** Convert spoken words into accurate text using state-of-the-art speech recognition (primarily leveraging OpenAI's Whisper).
*   **Summarize & Generate Notes:** Utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to create concise summaries, extract key discussion points, and identify action items from your transcripts.

**Core Principles:**

*   **Free & Open Source:** Built entirely with freely available and open-source components. We believe in community-driven development.
*   **Privacy First:** Prioritizes local processing. By default, your audio and meeting data stay on your machine, ensuring confidentiality.
*   **Cost-Effective:** Aims for zero to minimal operational costs for end-users.
*   **Modular & Extensible:** Designed with a clear architecture to be easy to understand, modify, and extend by contributors.

## Features (MVP)

*   In-browser audio recording using the `MediaRecorder` API.
*   Option to upload existing local audio files (e.g., `.wav`, `.mp3`, `.webm`).
*   Transcription using locally run instances of OpenAI Whisper (via Python backend or `whisper.cpp` for efficiency).
    *   User-selectable Whisper model size (e.g., `tiny`, `base`, `small`) to balance speed and accuracy, especially for CPU users.
*   Summarization using **OpenRouter.ai** (free-tier LLMs) via backend.
    *   Optional: Support for local LLMs (e.g., via Ollama) for summarization if configured by the user.
*   Clear display of generated transcript and summary/notes.
*   Functionality to download the transcript and summary (e.g., as `.txt` or `.md` files).
*   Simple interface to manage and view recently processed meetings (data stored locally in the browser or managed via downloaded files).

## Tech Stack (Primary for Local-First MVP)

*   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Potentially with a lightweight framework like Preact/Svelte, or plain JS for maximum simplicity. Vite for bundling and development server).
*   **Backend (Local Server):** Python (using Flask or FastAPI for orchestration).
*   **Transcription Engine:** OpenAI Whisper (Python package or `whisper.cpp` running locally on the user's machine).
*   **Summarization Engine (Default):** **OpenRouter.ai** (free-tier access to various models) called by the backend.
*   **Alternative Summarization (Local):** Ollama (running models like Mistral, LLaMA locally) for advanced users or full offline preference.

## Getting Started / Setup Instructions

**(This section will provide clear, step-by-step instructions to get a local instance of Joules V2 running.)**

**Prerequisites:**

*   Python 3.8+
*   `pip` (Python package installer)
*   A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
*   **(Highly Recommended for Local Summarization)** [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) installed, and at least one model pulled (e.g., `ollama pull mistral`).
*   **(Optional, for `whisper.cpp` users)** A C++ compiler and Make tools (specific instructions will be in the detailed setup).
*   **(Optional, for GPU acceleration with Whisper Python package)** An NVIDIA GPU, CUDA Toolkit, and cuDNN installed and configured.

**1. Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/joules-v2-free-edition.git
cd joules-v2-free-edition
```

**2. Setup Backend & Dependencies:**

```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory (e.g., backend/)
cd backend/

# Create a Python virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
# Activate the virtual environment:
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Initial Whisper model download may occur on first run of the backend,
# or provide specific instructions here if manual download is preferred.
# e.g., Python -c "import whisper; whisper.load_model('base')"
```

**3. Configure Local Services (if applicable):**

*   **Ollama:**
    *   Ensure your Ollama application is running if you intend to use it for summarization.
    *   Verify you have pulled a model: `ollama list` (if not, `ollama pull mistral` or another preferred model).
*   **Whisper.cpp:** (If this path is chosen, detailed compilation and model download instructions will be in `docs/detailed_setup.md`).

**4. Run the Backend Server:**

```bash
# From the backend directory (ensure virtual environment is active)
python app.py  # Or your main backend script (e.g., main.py for FastAPI)
# Expected output: Server running on http://localhost:5001 (or similar port as configured)
```

**5. Run the Frontend:**

*   **Option A (Simple HTML/JS - No Build Step):**
    *   Navigate to the `frontend/` directory (e.g., `cd ../frontend/`).
    *   Open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser.
*   **Option B (If using a JS framework with a build step like Vite):**
    ```bash
    # Navigate to the frontend directory (e.g., frontend/)
    cd ../frontend/
    npm install # or yarn install (if package-lock.json/yarn.lock exists)
    npm run dev # or yarn dev
    # Expected output: Frontend development server running on http://localhost:3000 (or similar)
    ```

**6. Using the Application:**

*   Open the frontend URL (e.g., `index.html` or `http://localhost:3000`) in your browser.
*   Use the "Record" button to capture new audio, or use the "Upload" button for an existing audio file.
*   Wait for the transcription and summarization processes to complete. Progress should be indicated.
*   View the generated transcript and summary.
*   Use the "Download" buttons to save your results.
