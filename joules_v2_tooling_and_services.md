# Joules V2 (Free Edition): Recommended Tooling and Services

This document lists free, open-source, and free-tier options for building and potentially deploying the Joules V2 meeting assistant. The primary goal is to minimize costs while maximizing functionality, with a strong emphasis on local-first processing for the MVP.

## 1. Frontend Development

*   **Core Technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript):**
    *   **Plain HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6+):**
        *   *Pros:* No external dependencies, full control, minimal build setup for simple UIs. Ideal for getting started quickly with basic interactions.
        *   *Cons:* Can become difficult to manage state and structure for more complex UIs without additional libraries/frameworks.
        *   *Recommendation:* Suitable for the initial MVP focusing on core functionality (Step 1-4 of MVP plan).
*   **JavaScript Frameworks/Libraries (Optional, for richer UI):**
    *   **React (via Vite):**
        *   *Pros:* Robust ecosystem, component-based architecture, declarative UI, many free UI component libraries (e.g., Material-UI, Chakra UI, Ant Design). Vite provides a fast development experience.
        *   *Cons:* Can be perceived as overkill for very simple projects; slightly larger learning curve and bundle size compared to "lighter" options.

        *   *Link:* [tailwindcss.com](https://tailwindcss.com/)
    *   **Minimalist CSS Frameworks (e.g., Pico.css, Sakura CSS, Water.css):**
        *   *Pros:* Very lightweight, provide sensible styling defaults with minimal or no classes to add to HTML, making basic sites look good quickly.
        *   *Links:* [picocss.com](https://picocss.com/), [oxal.org/sakura/](https://oxal.org/sakura/), [watercss.kognise.dev](https://watercss.kognise.dev/)
        *   *Recommendation:* Good for a quick, clean look with minimal effort.

## 2. Backend Development (Local First for MVP)

*   **Programming Languages & Frameworks:**
    *   **Python with Flask or FastAPI:**
        *   *Pros:* Excellent ecosystem for ML/AI tasks (OpenAI Whisper, various LLM libraries like `transformers`, `ctransformers`), relatively easy to learn. FastAPI provides modern features like automatic data validation (via Pydantic) and API documentation (Swagger UI/ReDoc), plus async support. Flask is simpler for smaller applications.
        *   *Cons:* Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) can be a limitation for CPU-bound concurrency, though async with FastAPI helps for I/O-bound tasks.
        *   *Links:* [flask.palletsprojects.com](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/), [fastapi.tiangolo.com](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
        *   *Recommendation:* **Primary recommendation for MVP backend** due to strong Python support for local AI/ML model integration.
    *   **Node.js with Express.js or Fastify:**
        *   *Pros:* Allows using JavaScript for both frontend and backend, efficient for I/O-heavy applications due to its non-blocking, event-driven architecture. Large NPM ecosystem.
        *   *Cons:* Integration with Python-based ML libraries might require inter-process communication or separate services if not using JS-native alternatives.

## 3. Audio Transcription

*   **Self-Hosted/Local (Primary for MVP):**
    *   **OpenAI Whisper (via `openai-whisper` Python package):**
        *   *Pros:* Official Python package, relatively easy to install (`pip install openai-whisper`) and use. Supports various model sizes (tiny, base, small, medium, large).
        *   *Cons:* Can be resource-intensive (RAM for model loading, CPU/GPU for processing), especially for larger models or real-time needs. `fp16=False` is often needed for CPU.
        *   *Link:* [github.com/openai/whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper)
        *   *Recommendation:* **Primary choice for local transcription in the MVP.**
    *   **`whisper.cpp`:**
        *   *Pros:* Plain C/C++ implementation of Whisper, optimized for CPU execution, generally faster and more resource-efficient than the Python package on CPU. Supports quantization. Good for creating cross-platform binaries.
        *   *Cons:* Requires compilation (though pre-built binaries might be available for some platforms), setup can be more involved. Python bindings exist.
        *   *Link:* [github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp)
        *   *Recommendation:* Excellent alternative for improved performance on CPU, especially if packaging the application.
*   **In-Browser (WASM - Future Exploration):**
    *   **`distil-whisper/whisper-web` (Xenova/Transformers.js):**
        *   *Pros:* Runs transcription entirely in the user's browser using WebAssembly. No backend needed for this step, enhancing privacy and reducing server load.
        *   *Cons:* Performance is highly dependent on the user's machine and browser. Larger initial download for the WASM model. May struggle with very long audio files or older devices.
        *   *Link:* [github.com/xenova/transformers.js](https://github.com/xenova/transformers.js) (includes Whisper)
*   **Free-Tier Cloud Transcription APIs (Use with clear user consent due to privacy implications and be mindful of limits):**
    *   **Hugging Face Inference API (for Whisper models):**
        *   *Pros:* Provides access to various Whisper model sizes hosted by Hugging Face. Has a free tier with rate limits.
        *   *Cons:* Audio data is uploaded to a third party. Subject to rate limits and potential latency.

    *   **OpenRouter.ai (Primary Recommendation):**
        *   *Pros:* Aggregates access to a wide variety of LLMs, many of which have free daily limits or generous trial credits (e.g., Mistral variants, Llama family models, Nous Research models). This is the **default recommended cloud summarization service for the MVP** due to its flexibility and access to capable models on free tiers. Simplifies backend by not needing to integrate multiple individual APIs.
        *   *Cons:* Free tier model availability and limits can change. Users need to sign up for an OpenRouter API key. Reliability depends on OpenRouter and the underlying model providers.
        *   *Link:* [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/)
    *   **Hugging Face Inference API (Secondary Alternative):**
        *   *Pros:* Access to many pre-trained summarization models (e.g., BART, PEGASUS, T5, and instruction-tuned models like some Mistral variants if available on free tier).
        *   *Cons:* Subject to rate limits, context window limitations, and potential costs if free tier limits are exceeded. Less model variety on free tier compared to OpenRouter.
        *   *Link:* [huggingface.co/inference-api](https://huggingface.co/inference-api)
    *   **Google AI Gemini API (Secondary Alternative):**
        *   *Pros:* Google offers a free tier for its Gemini models (e.g., Gemini Pro via API), which can be quite capable for summarization.
        *   *Cons:* Requires setting up a Google Cloud project for API key generation. Data privacy policies should be reviewed.
        *   *Link:* [ai.google.dev](https://ai.google.dev/)
    *   **Groq API (Secondary Alternative - if free access persists):**
        *   *Pros:* Offers very fast inference on select open-source models due to their LPU architecture. Often has free demo access which can be leveraged.
        *   *Cons:* Limited model selection, free access terms may change and might not be suitable for continuous free use.
        *   *Link:* [groq.com](https://groq.com/)

*   **Self-Hosted/Local LLMs (Alternative/Advanced User Option):**
    *   *Note:* This approach is for users who prefer full local control and are willing to manage the setup and resource demands. It's not the default MVP path for summarization but a valued alternative.
    *   **Ollama:**
        *   *Pros:* Extremely easy to set up and run a wide range of open-source LLMs (e.g., LLaMA series, Mistral, Gemma, Qwen) locally. Provides a simple REST API for interaction. Supports GPU acceleration.
        *   *Cons:* Requires the user to install Ollama application and download models (which can be several GBs each). Resource usage depends on the model.
        *   *Link:* [ollama.com](https://ollama.com/)
    *   **LM Studio:**
        *   *Pros:* User-friendly GUI for discovering, downloading, and running LLMs locally. Provides a local server compatible with OpenAI's API format.
        *   *Cons:* It's a desktop application, and like Ollama, resource-intensive depending on the model.
        *   *Link:* [lmstudio.ai](https://lmstudio.ai/)
    *   **Python Libraries (e.g., `ctransformers`, `llama-cpp-python`, Hugging Face `transformers`):**
        *   *Pros:* Allow more direct control over model loading, quantization (e.g., GGUF with `ctransformers` or `llama-cpp-python` for CPU efficiency), and inference within a Python application.
        *   *Cons:* Can be more complex to set up and manage than Ollama or LM Studio.
        *   *Links:* [github.com/marella/ctransformers](https://github.com/marella/ctransformers), [github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python](https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python)


## 5. Hosting & Deployment (Free Tiers - for potential future cloud version)

*   **Static Frontend Hosting (for HTML/JS/CSS and built static sites from frameworks):**
    *   **GitHub Pages:** Free, integrates directly with GitHub repositories. Only for static content.
    *   **Netlify / Vercel / Cloudflare Pages:** Generous free tiers, CI/CD integration, serverless functions (see below), custom domains, global CDN. **Excellent choices.**
*   **Backend / Serverless Functions Hosting (if moving beyond local-only backend):**
    *   **Netlify Functions / Vercel Serverless Functions:** Integrated with their static hosting, support Node.js, Go. Python support is available (Vercel generally, Netlify often requires specific setup). Good for API endpoints. Not suitable for long-running, resource-intensive processes like Whisper on large files (these should remain local or use dedicated services).
    *   **Render (Free Tier):** Offers free tiers for web services (Python, Node.js, Docker), background workers, and PostgreSQL. Services on the free tier sleep after inactivity and have limited resources.
    *   **Fly.io (Free Tier):** Provides free allowances for small applications (Dockerized), including persistent storage volumes (small free tier).
    *   **Railway.app (Trial/Free Tier):** Usage-based free trial credits, easy deployment from GitHub.
*   **Local Hosting (Primary for MVP):**
    *   The user runs the backend server (Flask/FastAPI or Node.js) on their own machine (`localhost`).
    *   *Pros:* Maximum privacy, no hosting costs, direct access to local hardware for demanding ML tasks.
    *   *Cons:* Requires the user to be technically capable of starting and managing a local server. Application is not accessible from other devices without tools like ngrok or Tailscale.

## 6. Storage (Free Tiers / Local)

*   **Browser LocalStorage / IndexedDB:**
    *   *Pros:* Entirely client-side, no network dependency, good for user preferences, application state, or small amounts of textual data (like drafts or settings).
    *   *Cons:* Limited storage capacity (typically 5-10MB for LocalStorage, more for IndexedDB but still browser-dependent). Not for large audio files.
*   **User's File System (via Download Links):**
    *   *Pros:* User retains full control over their data, effectively unlimited storage (bound by user's disk space). Simplest method for data persistence with maximum privacy.
    *   *Cons:* Requires manual user action to save. No centralized data management or synchronization across devices unless files are manually transferred.
    *   *Recommendation:* **Primary method for saving transcripts and summaries in the MVP.**
*   **Firebase Firestore (Free Tier - Spark Plan):**
    *   *Pros:* NoSQL document database with real-time capabilities. Offers a generous free tier (e.g., 1 GiB storage, 50k reads/day, 20k writes/day).
    *   *Cons:* Data stored on Google Cloud (privacy implications for sensitive meeting data). Vendor lock-in.
    *   *Link:* [firebase.google.com/docs/firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore)
*   **Supabase (Free Tier):**
    *   *Pros:* Open-source alternative to Firebase. Provides PostgreSQL, authentication, and storage with a free tier.
    *   *Cons:* Free tier has resource limits (e.g., database size, storage capacity).
    *   *Link:* [supabase.com](https://supabase.com/)

## 7. Calendar Integration (Optional - Post-MVP)

*   **Google Calendar API:**
    *   *Pros:* Widely used, official client libraries (including JavaScript for frontend integration).
    *   *Cons:* OAuth 2.0 setup can be complex for users and developers. API usage quotas and Google's privacy policies apply.
    *   *Link:* [developers.google.com/calendar/api](https://developers.google.com/calendar/api)
*   **Microsoft Graph API (for Outlook Calendar):**
    *   *Pros:* Similar capabilities for Microsoft ecosystem users.
    *   *Cons:* Similar OAuth 2.0 complexity and API considerations.
    *   *Link:* [developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph)
*   **Open-source iCalendar libraries (e.g., `ical.js`, Python `icalendar`):**
    *   *Pros:* Allow parsing of `.ics` calendar files if users can export/provide them. Avoids direct API integration and OAuth.
    *   *Cons:* Relies on manual file export/import by the user. Less seamless than direct API integration.

## 8. Speaker Diarization (For Multi-User Audio Processing - Future/Advanced)

Achieving high-quality, zero-cost speaker diarization is challenging, as FOSS options often require significant setup and compute resources, while cloud services can be costly or have limited free tiers.

*   **Open-Source Libraries:**
    *   **`pyannote.audio`:**
        *   *Pros:* Powerful open-source library for speaker diarization, segmentation, and even speech activity detection, based on PyTorch. Can deliver high accuracy.
        *   *Cons:* Can be resource-intensive (CPU/GPU, RAM). Setup might involve installing PyTorch and other dependencies. Pre-trained models require accepting user agreements (e.g., for `pyannote/segmentation-3.0` which uses HF).
        *   *Link:* [github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio)
        *   *Use Case:* Could be run on a local/self-hosted backend if users have sufficient resources.
    *   **WhisperX:**
        *   *Pros:* Known for providing accurate word-level timestamps for Whisper transcriptions. It also integrates speaker diarization, often by leveraging `pyannote.audio` or a similar library for the diarization step and then aligning it with the timestamped words.
        *   *Cons:* Diarization quality depends on the underlying diarization model used (often `pyannote`). Similar resource and setup considerations if `pyannote` is a dependency.
        *   *Link:* [github.com/m-bain/whisperX](https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX)
*   **Cloud APIs (Caution for Free Tier & Cost):**
    *   Major cloud providers (Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, AWS Transcribe, Azure AI Speech) offer speaker diarization.
    *   *Pros:* Can be highly accurate and convenient if already using these platforms.
    *   *Cons:* Generally part of paid tiers. Free quotas are typically very limited and not suitable for extensive use in a zero-cost project like Joules V2 Free Edition. Users must carefully check current free tier offerings and pricing.
*   **Challenges:**
    *   **Resource Intensity:** FOSS diarization models can be demanding.
    *   **Accuracy Variations:** Performance can vary based on audio quality, number of speakers, overlapping speech, and background noise.
    *   **Cost of Cloud Services:** Sustained use of cloud diarization APIs is generally not free.

## Recommendations for MVP (Local-First Emphasis):

*   **Frontend:** Plain HTML/CSS/JS or a lightweight option like Preact/Svelte managed with **Vite**.
*   **Backend:** **Python with Flask/FastAPI** running locally.
*   **Transcription:** **OpenAI Whisper Python package** (or `whisper.cpp` for performance enthusiasts) running locally.
*   **Summarization (Default MVP):** **OpenRouter.ai** (free-tier access to LLMs) called from the local backend.
    *   **Summarization (Advanced/Alternative):** **Ollama** (with a model like Mistral or Llama) running locally, for users preferring full local processing.
*   **Storage:** **User's File System** (via download) and **Browser LocalStorage** for settings.
*   **Speaker Diarization (Future/Advanced):** Tools like `pyannote.audio` or `WhisperX` are considerations for future enhancements, particularly for multi-user scenarios, likely requiring significant backend resources or careful management if integrated.

This combination prioritizes privacy for transcription, uses a flexible free-tier cloud service for default summarization to ease user setup, and leverages the strengths of Python for AI/ML tasks on the user's machine. Always verify the current terms and limitations of any free-tier services, as they can evolve.
